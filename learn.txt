=====> The frontController.

= One script that handles all request. In index.php file we have create page variable to pass query string page to render each 
   of the file within the index.php?page=home,list or product etc.
   Centralized Entry Point: Instead of having multiple PHP files in your web directory (e.g., login.php, profile.php), all
      requests (like example.com/login or example.com/profile) are directed by the webserver to a single PHP file. In Laravel
      and Symfony, this file is typically public/index.php. In WordPress, it's the index.php in the root directory.

   In short, the front controller acts like a traffic cop for your entire application. It ensures every request goes through
  a consistent process for security, routing, and session management before any specific application code is executed



=====> Why Frameworks like Laravel or Symfony Use a public/ Folder

Key Reason:
👉 To protect source code by exposing only what’s necessary to the browser.

==== Explanation ==== :
If a server is misconfigured and PHP execution is disabled, files may become directly downloadable from the browser.
For example: visiting http://example.com/project/public?page=home
could expose your raw .php code instead of executing it.
This allows attackers to download sensitive files and steal your source code.

Security Principle:
✅ Only keep publicly safe assets (like index.php, CSS, JS, and images) inside the public/ folder.
🚫 Keep all core code (app, config, vendor, etc.) outside the web-accessible directory.

Public folder -- A clear separation between public-facing files and sensitive application code and The public directory is designed to be the only folder exposed to the internet. When you configure a web server (like Apache or Nginx), you point its "document root" to the public folder. It Sets the Web Server's "Document Root". It Prevents Direct URL Access to web browsers to Sensitive Files. 

If all your files (including .env) were in the same folder that the web server points to, a request for
http://example.com/.env could potentially expose your database password, especially if the server is misconfigured to show
files as plain text instead of executing them.

So, we can say the public folder is used in a framework because it cleanly separates web accessible files from private code. which improve security and organization.
